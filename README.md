Specchio is a tool that can help you rsync your code, it uses `.gitignore` in git to discern which file is ignored.

Install
-------
pip install specchio

Usage
-----
specchio [options] src/ user@host:dst/

General Options
-----
--init-remote: Initialize remote folder, rsync all files to remote system.

Note
---
If you want to use specchio without decrypting private keys each time, try to use `ssh-add` at first.

Why I write Specchio
-------------------
I write my code on my local system, and the code should run it on a remote system.

Once I try to solve this problem by using `git` only, I use `git add`,  `git commit` and `git push` on my local system, and then use `git pull` to pull all of the code on remote system.

It solve the problem temporarily, but it generate some temporary commit message that I don't need.

I need a tool to rsync my code and ignore file following `.gitignore`, so Specchio born.
